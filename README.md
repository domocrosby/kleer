This should be pretty simple
- Install node.js & Heroku
- Just Fork and clone this repository (if owner then copy and change remote)\
- Change repository name to the name of the app 
- To setup a new dev app run "npm run setup-dev-app"
- To setup as a new dev environment run "npm run setup-dev", this will have saved the default auth address to the clipboard
- To authenticate the app run "npm run dev-auth" 
- To develop the app run "npm run dev"
- To create a staging environment on heroku use "npm run setup-dev", this will have saved the default auth address to the clipboard but you will need to enter the name of the app plus staging


TODO
- Create heroku staging app from script (create heroku account, )
- Add mongoDB to dev
- Setup mongoDB in scripts
- Do some interesting stuff
- 

- Create production app from script
- Auto pull production mongoDB into staging and
