This should be pretty simple
- Install node.js & Heroku
- Just Fork and clone this repository (if owner then copy and change remote)\
- Change repository name to the name of the app 
- To setup a new dev app run "npm run setup-dev-app", this will have saved the default auth address to the clipboard
- To setup as a new dev environment run "npm run setup-dev"
- To authenticate the app run "npm run dev-auth" 
- To develop the app run "npm run dev"
- To create a staging environment on heroku use "npm run setup-staging-app", this will have saved the default auth address to the clipboard but you will need to enter the name of the app plus staging
- To configure the staging environment run "npm run setup-staging"
- to authorize user on staging use "npm run staging-auth"
